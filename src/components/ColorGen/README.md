# ColorGen

### What?

ColorGen is a color shade generator that turns colors into configurable CSS custom parameters.

### Why?

While working on a project I was looking for a way to generate many CSS custom parameters for different colors I wanted to experiment with. Although I was able to achieve most of what I needed with SASS, I decided to write a simple JavaScript script so it was easier to use. That little script developed into a much more robust app.

### TODO

- Add button to shuffle color instead of having to remove and add a new one to generate a random color
- Allow the color output format to be any color format (hsl, rgb, hex, etc)
- Allow comment syntax to be changed to be compatible with CSS or SASS style comments (// comments or /\* comments \*/)
- Saving current colors in order to bookmark or share
