Are you up for promotion? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I'll be sure to note that in my log. Ensign Babyface! In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.",
